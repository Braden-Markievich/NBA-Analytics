For this project, I wanted to see how different statistics, specifically those I believed influenced the rise in overall scoring in the NBA, compared with the average team ppg from 1980 to the 2023-2024 season. All these stats were the average amount for a team in that respective season. Data was scraped from basketball-reference.
