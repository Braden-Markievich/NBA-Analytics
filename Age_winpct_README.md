For this project, I aimed to investigate the common belief that, on average, younger teams tend to begin the season strong, but struggles as the season progresses, while older, more veteran teams start slower but improve and receive more wins toward the middle and end of the season. For this, using CleaningTheGlass, I scraped through each team, and found the average age from the nine players who played the most minutes for their respective team during the 2023-24 NBA season. I then, using Basketball-Reference, found the winning percentage of each team at the first of every month from November to April. This data was finally visualized in a heatmap.
