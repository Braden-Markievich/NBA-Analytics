For this project, I wanted to analyze how players' points per shot (PPS) varied from different areas of the court. PPS is a great indicator of how valuable a certain shot is for a player. After scraping data from NBA.com, to illustrate this, I chose to use a heatmap to visualize each players' PPS in different zones. NOTE: The blank, white spaces in the heatmap represent zones where a player attempted less than 10 field goals, as these sample sizes were too small to include.
