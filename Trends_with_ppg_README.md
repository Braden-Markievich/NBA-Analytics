For this project, I aimed to examine how different statistics-specifically those I believed influenced the rise in overall scoring in the NBA-compared with the average team points per game (ppg) from 1980 to the 2023-2024 season. Each individual stat was the average amount for a team during the respective season. All data was scraped from basketball-reference.
