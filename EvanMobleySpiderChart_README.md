For this project, I aimed to analyze metrics that do an effective job of describing a player's overall offensive efficiency, and comparing them to other datasets to spot potential trends. Specifically, comparing the stats from the player's 2023-24 NBA season, the player's career averages, and the league averages for the 2023-24 season. Plotting these three groups together gives a comprehensive breakdown of a player's individual offensive development, along with how he compares to the rest of the league. All data was scraped from basketball-reference.
