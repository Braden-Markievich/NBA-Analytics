Repository includes code for visualizing analytics used when evaluating NBA players. Projects require data scraping, data collection and organization into csv files, then using matplotlib to create visualizations for the data.

These steps are also included as files within this repository.

Code that was used as web scraping has a .ipynb file extension, while code used to create the data visualization has a .py file extension. Final visualizations have .png file extensions.

Tools used for these projects include: JupyterLab, Matplotlib, Pandas, NBA.com, Basketball-Reference, CleaningTheGlass

This is an ongoing portfolio.
